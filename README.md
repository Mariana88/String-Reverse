## Solution Process

* Things that can be measured:
- lenght of the string  
- if lenght is odd or even

* Relevant Inputs I might receive:
- strings with a space in between

* Input classification:
- only classification that matters is the fact that input is a STRING

## Solution Explanation

Explain your solution in detail, however works for you.  Perhaps by using a specific input to illustrate, by listing the strategies you used, or by including a diagram [directly from Sketchboard.io](https://sketchboard.io/blog/2014/03/06/github-sketchboard.html).

## Language Features

List the language features used in your solution.

The focus of these exercises are to strengthen you problem solving skills, not to learn the newest ES6 tricks. When you have the choice between to different language features it is better to choose the option that is easiest to read, most common, or most consistent with the rest of your solution.  

Keeping track of the language features you use will enable you separate the problem solving strategy from the implementation.  Being aware of this difference will be an asset later on when you're faced with larger applications and popular frameworks.
